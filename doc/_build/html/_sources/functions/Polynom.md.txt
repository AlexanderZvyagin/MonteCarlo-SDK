# Polynom

The updater will compute a polynom of order N.

The number N is equal to the number of arguments passed to the Polynom updater.
The minimal number is 1, and in this case a constant function is defined.
Otherwise it will compute a0+a1*x+a2*x*x+..., where 'x'-is the
polynom argumnt (see below) and a0,a1... are arguments of the
function.

The polynopm argument 'x' is passed as 'reference', thus the updeter expects
strictly one reference and 1...N arguments. If Xref=-1, then the argument is current MC time.
Otherwise, it is a state number to which will be used as an 'x'-argument.

Examples: 
| Polynom | refs | args | Comment |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| P(t) = 44 | [-1] | [44] | A constant function |
| P(t) = 1+2*t^4 | [-1] | [1,0,0,0,2] | use ref=-1 for the time argument |
| P(x) = -x^2 | [123] | [0,0,-1] | assuming that state 123 holds the 'x' argument |
