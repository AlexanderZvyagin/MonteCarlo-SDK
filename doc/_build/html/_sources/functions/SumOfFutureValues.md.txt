# SumOfFutureValues


## Arguments _args_

an array of (monotnoically increasing) m time points T[i]:  T[0]<T[1]<...<T[m-1]

## References _args_

An array of size 1 with a reference process number N.

## Description

At every extraction point SumOfFutureValues state is computed as

SumOfFutureValues = sum(i = [j..N]) N[i]

where j is the first time point which is not less than t: T[j]>=t (and j==0 or T[j-1]<t). Which means that all past values will not be taken into the sum.

Between every two extraction points Ta,Tb the SumOfFutureValues value is constant.
